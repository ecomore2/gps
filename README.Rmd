# GPS data

There are 4 files containing GPS coordinates data in the `raw_data/GPS` folder:

* `Old Machine 2012-2015.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff
using the old GPS device;
* `New Machine2015-2018.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff using
the new GPS device;
* `Shared with app.xls` that contains data sent by patients through WhatsApp;
* `IPL Server.xlsx` that contains data sent by patients or volunteers from the
municipality, using the web application developped by IPL.

Cleaned data are merged with PACS data and written both in CSV and RDS in
`cleaned_data/pacs.csv` and `cleaned_data/pacs.rds`.
