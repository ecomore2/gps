## Preambule

There are 4 files containing GPS coordinates data in the `raw_data/GPS` folder:

* `Old Machine 2012-2015.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff
using the old GPS device;
* `New Machine2015-2018.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff using
the new GPS device;
* `Shared with app.xls` that contains data sent by patients through WhatsApp;
* `IPL Server.xlsx` that contains data sent by patients or volunteers from the
municipality, using the web application developped by IPL.

Cleaned data are written both in CSV and RDS in `cleaned_data/gps.csv` and
`cleaned_data/gps.rds`.

## Packages

Packages currently installed on the system:

```{r}
installed_packages <- rownames(installed.packages())
```

Packages that we need from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org):

```{r}
cran <- c("dplyr",        # data frames manipulation
          "geosphere",    # spherical trigonometry
          "magrittr",     # pipe operators
          "measurements", # tools for units measurement
          "purrr",        # functional programming tools
          "sp",           # classes and methods for spatial data
          "readxl",       # to read excel files
          "spatstat"      # spatial point pattern analysis
          )
```

Installing these packages when not already installed:

```{r}
to_install <- !cran %in% installed_packages
if (any(to_install)) install.packages(cran[to_install])
```

Loading the packages for interactive use at the command line:

```{r message = FALSE}
invisible(lapply(cran, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

## Utilitary functions

The following function convert DMS coordinates into decimal degrees coordiantes:

```{r}
dms2dd <- function(x) {
  require(magrittr)     # %>% 
  require(measurements) # conv_unit
  x %>%
    sub("°", " ", .) %>%
    sub("'", " ", .) %>%
    sub("\\.*''[EN]", "", .) %>%
    conv_unit("deg_min_sec", "dec_deg")
}
```

The following function identifies in a vector of coordinates the ones that are
in DMS and then uses the above function to convert them into decimal degrees
coordinates:

```{r}
dms2dd2 = function(x) {
 sel <- which(grepl("[EN]", x))
 x[sel] <- sapply(x[sel], dms2dd)
 as.numeric(x)
}
```

The following function reads and reformat GPS coordinates data collected from one
of the 2 GPS devices (the old and the new one) as well as from the WhatsApp app:

```{r}
read_gps <- function(file, tab, tabs) {
  require(dplyr)  # %>%, transmute
  require(readxl) # read_excel
  read_excel(file, grep(tab, tabs, TRUE, value = TRUE)) %>%
    transmute(id        = as.integer(`N° patient`),
              longitude = dms2dd2(sub("/",".", Longitude)),
              latitude  = dms2dd2(Latitude))
}
```

The following function returns the ID that have more than GPS coordinate record:

```{r}
check_duplicates <- function(df) {
  as.numeric(names(which(table(df[["id"]]) > 1)))
}
```

The following function takes a data frame with 2 columns, longitude and latitude
and two rows (2 points) and tests whether these 2 points have exactly the same
coordinates:

```{r}
are_same_points <- function(x) {
  require(purrr) # invoke
  invoke(identical, x$longitude) & invoke(identical, x$latitude)
}
```

The following function takes a data frame of coordinates and ID, and the ID that
has more than one entry in the data frame, and returns the distance in km between
these two entries:

```{r}
dist_btw_2_houses <- function(df, i) {
  require(dplyr)     # %>%, filter, select
  require(geosphere) # distHarversine
  tmp <- df %>%
    filter(id == i) %>%
    select(-id, -source) %>%
    as.matrix()
  distHaversine(tmp[1, ], tmp[2, ]) / 1000
}
```

## Reading data

Reading the GPS coordinates from the 4 sources:

```{r}
file <- "../../raw_data/GPS/all main data.xls"
tabs <- excel_sheets(file)
oldmachine <- read_gps(file, "old", tabs)
newmachine <- read_gps(file, "new", tabs)
smartphoneapp <- read_gps(file, "app", tabs)
iplserver <- read_excel(file, grep("server", tabs, TRUE, value = TRUE)) %>% 
             transmute(id        = as.integer(Reference),
                       longitude = Longitude,
                       latitude  = Latitude)
```

## Testing for duplicates in each of the 4 files, and fixing

```{r}
lapply(list(iplserver, smartphoneapp, oldmachine, newmachine), check_duplicates) %>% 
  setNames(c("iplserver", "smartphoneapp", "oldmachine", "newmachine"))
```

Note that patients `7681` and `6060` live in 2 different houses at the same
time (see issue [#1](https://github.com/ecomore2/gps/issues/1)), hence the reason
for their duplication. Patients `4374` and `6640` sent the GPS data twice (see
issue [#1](https://github.com/ecomore2/gps/issues/1)), so we can delete the first
coordinates for the 2 of them. Patient `5925` first reported the house only and
the coordinates were retrieved from Google Maps; then he sent the GPS coordinates
(see issue [#1](https://github.com/ecomore2/gps/issues/1)). So we can delete the
first coordinates for this one too:

```{r}
to_delete <- sapply(c(4374, 5925, 6640),
                    function(x) which(smartphoneapp$id == x)[1])
smartphoneapp <- smartphoneapp[-to_delete, ]
```

## Merging the 4 sources of data

```{r}
gps <- bind_rows(server   = iplserver,
                 whatsapp = smartphoneapp,
                 old_gps  = oldmachine,
                 new_gps  = newmachine, .id = "source")
```

Looking for GPS coordinates that have been taken by more than one mean:

```{r}
duplicates <- check_duplicates(gps)
```

Here we remove the duplicates that are exactly the same points:

```{r}
duplicates <- gps %>%
  filter(id %in% duplicates) %>%
  split(.$id) %>%
  sapply(are_same_points) %>%
  `!`() %>%
  which() %>%
  names() %>%
  as.numeric()
```

Now we look to what sources these duplicates are:

```{r}
duplicates <- list(iplserver, smartphoneapp, oldmachine, newmachine) %>% 
  sapply(function(x) is.element(duplicates, x$id)) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  setNames(c("server", "whatsapp", "oldgps", "newgps")) %>%
  mutate(id = duplicates) %>% 
  select(id, everything())
duplicates
```

So, we have 20 houses that were checked both with WhatsApp and the server:

```{r}
duplicates %>%
  filter(whatsapp, newgps) %>% 
  nrow()
```

One house that was checked both with the server and by the GPS:

```{r}
duplicates %>%
  filter(server, newgps) %>% 
  nrow()
```

And the 2 patients that live in 2 houses (see above):

```{r}
names(which(rowSums(duplicates) < 2))
```

Patients 4445, 4536, 4582, 4600, 4632, 4831, 4840, 4897, 5018, 5019, 5033, 5122,
5217, 5218, 5251, 5252, 5254, 6323, 7413 and 7436 had their coordinates reported
both on-site from GPS device and through the smartphone app in order to assess
the accuracy of the latter (see issue #3). Thus we can remove these ID from the
smartphone data. But, before that, we can look at the distances between the two
means of data collection. Let's first get the ID of these duplicates:

```{r}
dpl <- duplicates %>%
  filter(whatsapp, newgps) %>%
  select(id) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  unname()
```

The following function makes a matrix of coordinates as required by the function
`distHaversine`:

```{r}
make_coord_mat <- function(df, idsel, sourcesel) {
  df %>%
    filter(id %in% idsel, source == sourcesel) %>% 
    arrange(id) %>%  # to make sure that the coordinates are in the same order
    select(longitude, latitude) %>%  # in the two matrices
    as.matrix()
}
```

```{r}
dpl_nw <- make_coord_mat(gps, dpl, "new_gps")
dpl_sp <- make_coord_mat(gps, dpl, "whatsapp")
sort(distHaversine(dpl_nw, dpl_sp)) / 1000
```

Let's remove all the whatsapp data that are also collected by GPS, as well as
the server datum that is also collected by GPS:

```{r}
whatsapp_dplcts <- duplicates %>%
  filter(whatsapp, newgps) %>%
  select(id) %>%
  unlist()
gps %<>% filter(!(id %in% whatsapp_dplcts & source == "whatsapp"))
```

Let's do the same with the server datum. For ID 8101, the coordinates were
collected on-site with GPS device by mistake, forgetting that the patient had
aleady sent the data through the server
(see issue [#1](https://github.com/ecomore2/gps/issues/1)). Let's first look at
the distance:

```{r}
ip <- make_coord_mat(gps, "8101", "server")
nm <- make_coord_mat(gps, "8101", "new_gps")
distHaversine(ip, nm) / 1000
```

And then we remove the server datum:

```{r}
server_dplcts <- duplicates %>%
  filter(server, newgps) %>%
  select(id) %>%
  unlist()
gps %<>% filter(!(id %in% server_dplcts & source == "server"))
```

We can check that the only 2 duplicated IDs and the ones that live in two
different houses:

```{r}
gps %>%
  select(id) %>%
  table() %>%
  `>`(1) %>%
  which() %>%
  names()
```

We can fancy looking at the distances, in km, between these two houses:

```{r}
dist_btw_2_houses(gps, 6060)
dist_btw_2_houses(gps, 7681)
```

Let's check whether there are missing values in the coordinates:

```{r}
filter(gps, is.na(longitude) | is.na(latitude))
```

Let's remove the points with missing values in the coordinates:

```{r}
gps %<>% na.exclude()
```

## Checking that GPS coordinates are in Vientiane Capital

Let's get the polygons of the provinces of Lao PDR:

```{r}
provinces <- readRDS("../../cleaned_data/gadm/gadm36_LAO_1_sp.rds")
```

Let's extract the province of Vientiane Capital:

```{r}
vientiane <- subset(provinces, grepl("Vientiane", provinces$VARNAME_1))
```

Let's identify the GPS points that are not inside the polygon of the province of
Vientiane Capital:

```{r}
not_in_vc <- gps %>%
  select(-id, -source) %>% 
  SpatialPoints(CRS(proj4string(vientiane))) %>% 
  over(vientiane) %>% 
  `[`(, 1) %>% 
  is.na() %>% 
  which()
gps[not_in_vc, ]
```

Those for the which the latitude is above 100 actually have the longitude
instead of the latitude:

```{r}
gps[not_in_vc, ] %>%
  filter(latitude > 100) %$%
  identical(longitude, latitude)
```

Removing them leaves:

```{r}
filter(gps[not_in_vc, ], latitude < 100)
```

ID `7004` is obviously a mistake, let's remove it too:

```{r}
out_of_vc <- filter(gps[not_in_vc, ], latitude < 100, longitude > 100)
```

And let's see where these points left are on the map:

```{r}
plot(provinces, col = "grey")
with(out_of_vc, points(longitude, latitude, col = "red"))
```

`7136` is from **Phôngsali province**! The other ones are actually very close to
Vientiane capital:

```{r}
plot(vientiane, col = "grey")
with(out_of_vc, points(longitude, latitude, col = "red"))
```
