IMAGES:
Insert them with: ![alt text](image.png)
You can also resize them if needed: convert image.png -resize 50% image.png
If you want to center the image, go through HTML code:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="image.png"/></div>

REFERENCES:
For references: Put all the bibTeX references in the file "references.bib"
in the current folder and cite the references as @key or [@key] in the text.
Uncomment the bibliography field in the above header and put a "References"
title wherever you want to display the reference list.

# GPS data

There are 4 files containing GPS coordinates data in the `raw_data/GPS` folder of
the Dropbox:

* `Old Machine 2012-2015.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff
using the old GPS device;
* `New Machine2015-2018.xls` that contains data collected by the IPL staff using
the new GPS device;
* `Shared with app.xls` that contains data sent by patients through WhatsApp;
* `IPL Server.xlsx` that contains data sent by patients or volunteers from the
municipality, using the web application developped by IPL.

The data cleaned by this [pipeline](https://ecomore2.github.io/gps/make_data.html),
are saved to the
[`data/pacs.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecomore2/gps/master/data/gps.csv)
CSV file that can be copied and paste to a text file on your computer or downloaded
directly from R into a data frame:

```{r}
if (! "readr" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) install.packages("readr")
pacs <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecomore2/gps/master/data/gps.csv", col_types = "icdd")
```

This [summary](https://ecomore2.github.io/gps/summarize_data.html) provides a
real-time overview of the current state of the PACS data set, highlighting
problems that remain to be fixed.
